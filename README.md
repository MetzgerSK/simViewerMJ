# simViewerMJ #
This repository houses the Shiny app to view Metzger and Jones' simulation results from "Getting Time Right."  The app runs via Binder.

## App Launch ##
- Direct Shiny launch: 
[![Launch Rstudio Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MetzgerSK/simViewerMJ/master?urlpath=shiny/)

- Indirect launch via RStudio: [![Launch Rstudio Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MetzgerSK/simViewerMJ/master?urlpath=rstudio/) <br> <em>(If launching Shiny directly produces a Shiny initialization time-out error and refreshing the page doesn't fix things, use this method.  Type `shiny::runApp()` once RStudio initializes to start the app.)</em>
